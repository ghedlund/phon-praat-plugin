    <title>Pitch Listing Query</title>
    <shortdesc>Using the <uicontrol>PitchListing</uicontrol> query.</shortdesc>
    <taskbody>
        <context>
            <p>Use this query for generating lists of pitch values for phones or strings of phones
                identified through user-determined criteria. For example, these include single
                phones (e.g. <codeph>[a]</codeph>), groups of phone (e.g. <codeph>{stop}</codeph>),
                or sequences of phones (e.g. <codeph>[an]</codeph>). The user can also perform these
                tasks on strings defined in terms of syllables, word, and word groups.</p>

                    or <uicontrol>IPA Actual</uicontrol> tiers and may configure <xref
