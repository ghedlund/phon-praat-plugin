 <title>Spectrogram Settings</title>
 <shortdesc>Configuring the spectrogram.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>
   <dl>
    <dlentry>
     <dt><i>Max Frequency</i> (Hz) </dt>
     <dd> the range of frequencies to display. The standard is 0 Hz at the bottom and 5000 Hz at the
      top. If this maximum frequency is higher than the Nyquist frequency of the Sound (which is
      half its sampling frequency), some values in the spectrogram will be zero, and the higher
      frequencies will be drawn in white. You can see this if you record a Sound at 44100 Hz and set
      the view range from 0 Hz to 25000 Hz. </dd>
    </dlentry>
    <dlentry>
     <dt><i>Window length</i></dt>
     <dd> the duration of the analysis window. If this is 0.005 seconds (the standard), Praat uses
      for each frame the part of the sound that lies between 0.0025 seconds before and 0.0025
      seconds after the centre of that frame (for Gaussian windows, Praat actually uses a bit more
      than that). The window length determines the <i>bandwidth</i> of the spectral analysis, i.e.
      the width of the horizontal line in the spectrogram of a pure sine wave (see below). For a
      Gaussian window, the -3 dB bandwidth is 2*sqrt(6*ln(2))/(Ï€*<i>Window length</i>), or 1.2982804
      / <i>Window length</i>. To get a `broad-band' spectrogram (bandwidth 260 Hz), keep the
      standard window length of 5 ms; to get a `narrow-band' spectrogram (bandwidth 43 Hz), set it
      to 30 ms (0.03 seconds). The other window shapes give slightly different values. </dd>
    </dlentry>
    <dlentry>
     <dt><i>Dynamic range</i> (dB) </dt>
     <dd> All values that are more than <i>Dynamic range</i> dB below the maximum will be drawn in
      white. Values in-between have appropriate shades of grey. Thus, if the highest peak in the
      spectrogram has a height of 30 dB/Hz, and the dynamic range is 50 dB (which is the standard
      value), then values below -20 dB/Hz will be drawn in white, and values between -20 dB/Hz and
      30 dB/Hz will be drawn in various shades of grey. </dd>
    </dlentry>
    <dlentry>
     <dt><i>Window shape</i></dt>
     <dd> the shape of the analysis window. To compute the spectrum at, say, 3.850 seconds, samples
      that lie close to 3.850 seconds are given more weight than samples further away. The relative
      extent to which each sample contributes to the spectrum is given by the window shape. You can
      choose from: Gaussian, Square (none, rectangular), Hamming (raised sine-squared), Bartlett
      (triangular), Welch (parabolic), and Hanning (sine-squared). The Gaussian window is superior,
      as it gives no <i>sidelobes</i> in your spectrogram (see below); it analyzes a factor of 2
      slower than the other window shapes, because the analysis is actually performed on twice as
      many samples per frame. </dd>
    </dlentry>
    <dlentry>
     <dt><i>Time step</i></dt>
     <dd> the maximum number of points along the time window for which Praat has to compute the
      spectrum. If your screen is not wider than 1200 pixels, then the standard of 1000 is
      appropriate, since there is no point in computing more than one spectrum per one-pixel-wide
      vertical line. If you have a really wide screen, you may see improvement if you raise this
      number to 1500. </dd>
    </dlentry>
    <dlentry>
     <dt><i>Frequency step</i></dt>
     <dd> the maximum number of points along the frequency axis for which Praat has to compute the
      spectrum. If your screen is not taller than 768 pixels, then the standard of 250 is
      appropriate, since there is no point in computing more than one spectrum per one-pixel-height
      horizontal line. If you have a really tall screen, you may see improvement if you raise this
      number. </dd>
    </dlentry>
    <dlentry>
     <dt><i>Window shape</i></dt>
     <dd> the shape of the analysis window. To compute the spectrum at, say, 3.850 seconds, samples
      that lie close to 3.850 seconds are given more weight than samples further away. The relative
      extent to which each sample contributes to the spectrum is given by the window shape. You can
      choose from: Gaussian, Square (none, rectangular), Hamming (raised sine-squared), Bartlett
      (triangular), Welch (parabolic), and Hanning (sine-squared). The Gaussian window is superior,
      as it gives no <i>sidelobes</i> in your spectrogram (see below); it analyzes a factor of 2
      slower than the other window shapes, because the analysis is actually performed on twice as
      many samples per frame. </dd>
    </dlentry>
    <dlentry>
     <dt><i>Preemphasis</i> (dB/octave) </dt>
     <dd> determines the steepness of a high-pass filter, i.e., how much the power of higher
      frequencies will be raised before drawing, as compared to lower frequencies. Since the
      spectral slope of human vowels is approximately -6 dB per octave, the standard value for this
      setting is +6 dB per octave, so that the spectrum is flattened and the higher formants look as
      strong as the lower ones. When you raise the preemphasis, frequency bands above 1000 Hz will
      become darker, those below 1000 Hz will become lighter. </dd>
     </dlentry>
    <dlentry><dt><i>Dynamic compression</i></dt>
     <dd> determines how much stronger weak spectra should be made before drawing. Normally, this
      parameter is between 0 and 1. If it is 0 (the standard value), there is no dynamic
      compression. If it is 1, all spectra will be drawn equally strong, i.e., all of them will
      contain frequencies that are drawn in black. If this parameter is 0.4 and the global maximum
      is at 80 dB, then a spectrum with a maximum at 20 dB (which will normally be drawn all white
      if the dynamic range is 50 dB), will be raised by 0.4 * (80 - 20) = 24 dB, so that its maximum
      will be seen at 44 dB (thus making this frame visible). </dd>
